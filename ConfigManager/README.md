This directory contains scripts for Microsoft's System Center Configuration Manager.
The naming convention will generally follow Verb-SccmNoun to avoid overlap with 
Microsoft's Verb-CMNoun naming convention.

Some scripts may be interdependent. For example, Get-SCCMCollectionMembership depends
on Get-SCCMSite to determine the site information.
